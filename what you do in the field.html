                Bioengineering combines engineering principles with biological systems and biomedical technologies. Research in this field can lead to new imaging  technologies, tissue engineered organs, portable disease diagnostic devices, etc. Bioengineers try to mimic biological systems to modify them,or control them so they can be replace, sustain, or predict chemical and mechanical processes. Here are some things you can do after college:
                <ul>
                    <li>Go to graduate school to earn a master's degree in engineering or a related field</li>
                    <li>Go to medical school to become a doctor, anestisiologist, etc.</li>
                    <li>Work in a research lab, hospital or private practice</li>
                </ul>
